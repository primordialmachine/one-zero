\chapter{Synopsis}
C++ 17 library providing functors returning the zero value and the one value.\newline
\noindent{}Implementations are provided for most built-in types.\newline
\noindent{}Furthermore, consumers of this library can easily add specializations of these functors for built-in and user-defined types.\newline

\noindent{}The library is made available publicly on
\href{\GetLibraryRepository}{Github}
under the
\href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/LICENSE}{MIT License}.

\chapter{Requirements}
None.

\chapter{Limitations and Restrictions}
The library officially only supports Visual Studio 2017 and Windows 10.
