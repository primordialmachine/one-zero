\chapter{Synopsis}
C++ 17 library providing extendable abstractions of the constants zero and one.\newline

\noindent{}This library provides functors which return the constant zero and one for most built-in types.
Furthermore, a consumer of this library can add additional partial specializations of these functors for arbitrary types.\newline

\noindent{}The library is made available publicly on
\href{\GetLibraryRepository}{Github}
under the
\href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/LICENSE}{MIT License}.

\chapter{Requirements}
None.

\chapter{Limitations and Restrictions}
The library officially only supports Visual Studio 2017 and Windows 10.

\chapter{Introductory example}
\textit{\color{orange}This library does not provide any examples yet.}
%Examples are located in the \href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/examples}{examples} directory.

\chapter{Library Interface Documentation}

\section{\texttt{namespace primordialmachine}}
The namespace this library is adding its declarations/definitions to.
The added namespace elements are documented below.

\section{\texttt{zero\_functor\textlangle TYPE\textrangle}}
\begin{verbatim}
template<typename TYPE>
struct zero_functor;
\end{verbatim}
Provides a const constexpr noexcept \texttt{operator()} which receives zero arguments and returns a
value of type \texttt{TYPE} approximating the value $0$ (zero).
Specializations for the types
\texttt{char},
\texttt{signed char},
\texttt{unsigned char},
\texttt{signed short int}       (aka \texttt{short int},     aka \texttt{signed short},     aka \texttt{short}),
\texttt{signed long int}        (aka \texttt{long int},      aka \texttt{signed long},      aka \texttt{long}),
\texttt{signed long long int}   (aka \texttt{long long int}, aka \texttt{signed long long}, aka \texttt{long long}),
\texttt{unsigned short int}     (aka \texttt{unsigned short}),
\texttt{unsigned long int}      (aka \texttt{unsigned long}), and
\texttt{unsigned long long int} (aka \texttt{unsigned long long}),
\texttt{float},
\texttt{double}, and
\texttt{long double}
are provided.

\section{\texttt{one\_functor\textlangle TYPE\textrangle}}
\begin{verbatim}
template<typename TYPE>
struct one_functor;
\end{verbatim}
Provides a const constexpr noexcept \texttt{operator()} which receives zero arguments and returns a
value of type \texttt{TYPE} approximating the value $1$ (one).
Specializations for the types
\texttt{char},
\texttt{signed char},
\texttt{unsigned char},
\texttt{signed short int}       (aka \texttt{short int},     aka \texttt{signed short},     aka \texttt{short}),
\texttt{signed long int}        (aka \texttt{long int},      aka \texttt{signed long},      aka \texttt{long}),
\texttt{signed long long int}   (aka \texttt{long long int}, aka \texttt{signed long long}, aka \texttt{long long}),
\texttt{unsigned short int}     (aka \texttt{unsigned short}),
\texttt{unsigned long int}      (aka \texttt{unsigned long}), and
\texttt{unsigned long long int} (aka \texttt{unsigned long long}),
\texttt{float},
\texttt{double}, and
\texttt{long double}
are provided.

\section{\texttt{zero\textlangle TYPE\textrangle()}}
Function returning an approximation of type \texttt{TYPE} of the value $0$ (zero).
\begin{verbatim}
template<typename TYPE>
constexpr auto zero() -> decltype(zero_functor<TYPE>()())
{ return zero_functor<TYPE>()(); }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}Provides a constexpr \texttt{operator()} which receives zero arguments and returns a value of type
\texttt{decltype\allowbreak(zero\allowbreak\_functor\allowbreak<TYPE>\allowbreak()())} approximating the value $0$ (zero).
The function is noexcept if \texttt{zero\allowbreak\_\allowbreak functor<TYPE>()()} is noexcept otherwise not.

\section{\texttt{one\textlangle TYPE\textrangle()}}
Function returning an approximation of type \texttt{TYPE} of the value $1$ (one).
\begin{verbatim}
template<typename TYPE>
constexpr auto one() -> decltype(one_functor<TYPE>()())
{ return one_functor<TYPE>()(); }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}Provides a constexpr \texttt{operator()} which receives zero arguments and returns a value of type
\texttt{decltype(one\allowbreak\_functor\allowbreak<TYPE>\allowbreak()())} approximating the value $1$ (one).
The function is noexcept if \texttt{one\allowbreak\_\allowbreak functor<TYPE>()()} is noexcept otherwise not.
