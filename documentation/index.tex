\section{Synopsis}
C++ 17 library providing extendable abstractions of the constants zero and one.\newline

\noindent{}This library provides functors which return the constant zero and one for most built-in types.
Furthermore, a consumer of this library can add additional partial specializations of these functors for arbitrary types.\newline

\noindent{}The library is made available publicly on
\href{\GetLibraryRepository}{Github}
under the
\href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/LICENSE}{MIT License}.

\section{Requirements}
None.

\section{Limitations and Restrictions}
The library officially only supports Visual Studio 2017 and Windows 10.

\section{Introductory example}
\textit{\color{orange}This library does not provide any examples yet.}
%Examples are located in the \href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/examples}{examples} directory.

\section{Building under Visual Studio 2017}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the solution \texttt{solution.sln} in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
\item Batch build everything.
\item The folder \texttt{packages} contains the distribution of the library i.e. include files and the
      static libraries for
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the platforms \texttt{Win32} and \texttt{x64} and
    \item configurations \texttt{Release} and \texttt{Debug}.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Copy the contents of the \verb+packages+ folder into a directory. Let
      \verb+[library home]+ be a placeholder denoting the path by which that folder
      can be referenced from your project.
\item Add
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the include path
\begin{verbatim}
[library home]/primordialmachine/one-zero-functors/
$(Platform.toLower())/$(Configuration.toLower())/includes
\end{verbatim}
	and
    \item the library path
\begin{verbatim}
[library home]/primordialmachine/one-zero-functors/
$(Platform.toLower())/$(Configuration.toLower())/libraries
\end{verbatim}
    to your project.
\end{enumerate}
\item Link your project with the library \verb+one-zero-functors.lib+.
\item Add the include directive \verb+#include "primordialmachine/one_zero_functors/include.hpp"+ where appropriate.
\item You can now use the functionality provided by the library.
\end{enumerate}
