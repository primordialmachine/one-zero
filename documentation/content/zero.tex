\begin{verbatim}
template<typename TYPE>
struct zero_functor;
\end{verbatim}
Provides a constant constexpr noexcept \texttt{operator()} which receives zero arguments and returns a
value of type \texttt{TYPE} approximating the value $0$ (zero).
Specializations for the types
\texttt{char},
\texttt{signed char},
\texttt{unsigned char},
\texttt{signed short int}       (aka \texttt{short int},     aka \texttt{signed short},     aka \texttt{short}),
\texttt{signed long int}        (aka \texttt{long int},      aka \texttt{signed long},      aka \texttt{long}),
\texttt{signed long long int}   (aka \texttt{long long int}, aka \texttt{signed long long}, aka \texttt{long long}),
\texttt{unsigned short int}     (aka \texttt{unsigned short}),
\texttt{unsigned long int}      (aka \texttt{unsigned long}), and
\texttt{unsigned long long int} (aka \texttt{unsigned long long}),
\texttt{float},
\texttt{double}, and
\texttt{long double}
are provided.

\section{\texttt{zero\textlangle TYPE\textrangle()}}
Function returning an approximation of type \texttt{TYPE} of the value $0$ (zero).
\begin{verbatim}
template<typename TYPE>
constexpr auto zero() noexcept(noexcept(zero_functor<TYPE>()()))
  -> decltype(zero_functor<TYPE>()())
{ return zero_functor<TYPE>()(); }
\end{verbatim}
The function is constexpr if verb+zero_functor<TYPE>()()` is constexpr.
