\section{\textit{concept Functor}}
A functor is a struct type providing a constant  \texttt{operator()}.
That operator shall be qualified as \texttt{noexcept}     if possible
and shall be qualified as \texttt{constexpr} if possible.  The return
type of \texttt{operator()} shall be of type \texttt{result}    (or a
cv-qualified variant of that).\newline\noindent{}The functor    shall
provide the member type definition \texttt{result\_type} denoting the
type \texttt{result}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\textit{concept BinaryFunctor}}
A \textit{BinaryFunctor} is a \textit{Functor}.
Its \texttt{operator()} has two parameters \texttt{left\_operand} of type
\texttt{left\_operand\_type} (or a cv-qualified variant of that)      and 
\texttt{right\_operand} of type \texttt{right\_operand\_type} (or       a
cv-qualified variant of that).\newline

\noindent{}The functor shall provide the member type              definitions
\texttt{left\_operand\_type}  denoting the type \texttt{left\_operand}    and
\texttt{right\_operand\_type} denoting the type      \texttt{right\_operand}.
\newline

\section{\textit{concept BinaryFunctorBase}}
A  \textit{BinaryFunctorBase} is a template struct type of   name \textit{name}
with three template parameters \texttt{LEFT\_OPERAND}, \texttt{RIGHT\_OPERAND},
and \texttt{ENABLED}. The default value of \texttt{ENALBED} is   \texttt{void}.
Specializations of this template may use \texttt{ENABLED} to    perform SFINAE.
A possible implementation is
\texttt{\newline
\noindent{}template\textlangle typename LEFT\_OPERAND, typename RIGHT\_OPERAND,
typename ENABLED = void\textrangle\newline\noindent{}struct \textit{name};    }
\newline

\noindent{}Its partial specializations are \textit{BinaryFunctors}.

\section{\textit{concept UnaryFunctor}}
An \textit{UnaryFunctor} is \textit{Functor}.
Its \texttt{operator()} has one parameter \texttt{operand}  of type
\texttt{operand\_type} (or a cv-qualified variant of that).\newline

\noindent{}The functor shall provide the member type definition
\texttt{operand\_type} denoting the type      \texttt{operand}.

\section{\textit{concept UnaryFunctorBase}}
An \textit{UnaryFunctorBase} is a template struct type of     name \textit{name}
with two  template parameters \texttt{OPERAND} and \texttt{ENABLED}. The default
value of \texttt{ENALBED} is \texttt{void}. Specializations of this template may
use \texttt{ENABLED} to perform SFINAE.
A possible implementation is
\texttt{\newline
\noindent{}template\textlangle typename OPERAND,
typename ENABLED = void\textrangle\newline\noindent{}struct \textit{name};    }
\newline

\noindent{}Its partial specializations are \textit{UnaryFunctors}.
